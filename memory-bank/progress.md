# Progress: Opcode Microprocessor Simulator

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Initial Setup and Planning

The project is currently in the early stages of development. The basic Spring Boot application structure has been set up, and comprehensive documentation has been created. The implementation of the core domain model is the next immediate task.

## What Works

1. **Project Setup**
   - ✅ Spring Boot application structure
   - ✅ Gradle build configuration
   - ✅ Basic project structure with packages
   - ✅ Swagger/OpenAPI integration

2. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Technical specification
   - ✅ API specification
   - ✅ Implementation plan
   - ✅ Memory bank documentation

3. **Initial Components**
   - ✅ Dummy controller for testing setup
   - ✅ Basic service structure
   - ✅ Model classes for responses

4. **Core Components**
   - ✅ RegisterName enum for type-safe register identification
   - ✅ Register class with proper encapsulation
   - ✅ RegisterManager with enum-based implementation
   - ✅ Unit tests for register components

## What's Left to Build

### Task 1: Core Domain Model Implementation
- ✅ RegisterManager class
- ⬜ Instruction interface
- ⬜ AbstractInstruction class
- ⬜ Exception classes
- ⬜ Unit tests for core components

### Task 2: Execute Single Instruction API
- ⬜ Concrete instruction classes (SET, ADR, ADD, MOV, INR, DCR, RST)
- ⬜ Instruction factory
- ⬜ Instruction parser
- ⬜ Processor core functionality
- ⬜ Service method for executing a single instruction
- ⬜ POST /api/v1/instructions endpoint
- ⬜ Unit and integration tests

### Task 3: Execute Batch Instructions API
- ⬜ Service method for executing multiple instructions
- ⬜ POST /api/v1/instructions/batch endpoint
- ⬜ Error handling for partial execution
- ⬜ Unit and integration tests

### Task 4: Register Value APIs
- ⬜ Service methods for retrieving register values
- ⬜ GET /api/v1/registers endpoint
- ⬜ GET /api/v1/registers/{register} endpoint
- ⬜ Error handling for invalid registers
- ⬜ Unit and integration tests

### Task 5: Reset Processor API
- ⬜ Service method for resetting the processor
- ⬜ POST /api/v1/processor/reset endpoint
- ⬜ Unit and integration tests

### Task 6: API Documentation and Final Integration
- ⬜ Complete Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- ⬜ End-to-end tests
- ⬜ Final validation and testing
- ⬜ README with setup and usage instructions

## Known Issues

1. No significant issues at this stage as implementation has not yet begun.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Command Pattern for Instructions**
   - Initial Decision: Use the Command pattern to implement instructions
   - Rationale: Provides a clean way to encapsulate instruction behavior and makes it easy to add new instructions
   - Status: Planned for implementation

2. **Factory Pattern for Instruction Creation**
   - Initial Decision: Use a factory to create instruction objects
   - Rationale: Centralizes instruction creation logic and simplifies adding new instruction types
   - Status: Planned for implementation

3. **Registry Pattern for Register Management**
   - Initial Decision: Implement a registry to manage registers
   - Rationale: Makes it easy to add new registers and provides a consistent interface for register operations
   - Status: Implemented with enum-based type safety
   - Update: Enhanced with RegisterName enum and proper encapsulation for better type safety and maintainability

### API Design Decisions

1. **RESTful API Structure**
   - Initial Decision: Follow RESTful principles for API design
   - Rationale: Provides a clean, intuitive interface for clients
   - Status: API specification complete, implementation pending

2. **Error Handling Approach**
   - Initial Decision: Use custom exceptions and a global exception handler
   - Rationale: Provides consistent error responses across the API
   - Status: Planned for implementation

### Testing Decisions

1. **TDD Approach**
   - Initial Decision: Use Test-Driven Development where appropriate
   - Rationale: Ensures code quality and correctness
   - Status: Planned for implementation

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Initial Decision: Aim for high test coverage, especially for core logic
   - Rationale: Ensures reliability and makes refactoring safer
   - Status: Planned for implementation

## Next Milestone

**Milestone**: Complete Task 1 - Core Domain Model Implementation

**Target Date**: September 9, 2025

**Success Criteria**:
- RegisterManager implemented and tested
- Instruction interface and AbstractInstruction class created
- Exception classes implemented
- Unit tests passing with good coverage
