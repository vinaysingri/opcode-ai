# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Core Domain Model Implementation ✓
- Implemented RegisterManager
- Created Register and RegisterName classes
- Added core exceptions
- Completed unit tests
- Status: COMPLETED

### Task 2: Execute Single Instruction API ✓
- Implemented all seven instruction classes:
  * SET: Sets register to value
  * ADR: Adds register to register
  * ADD: Adds value to register
  * MOV: Copies register to register
  * INR: Increments register
  * DCR: Decrements register
  * RST: Resets all registers
- Created InstructionFactory and Parser
- Implemented Processor facade
- Added ProcessorService and Controller
- Set up error handling
- Added comprehensive tests
- Added API documentation
- Fixed dependency injection
- Status: COMPLETED

## Current Task

### Task 3: Execute Batch Instructions API
- Implement batch execution endpoint
- Add batch request/response models
- Handle partial execution failures
- Add batch validation
- Implement rollback mechanism
- Add batch execution tests
- Status: NOT STARTED

## Upcoming Tasks

### Task 4: Register Value APIs
- Implement get all registers endpoint
- Implement get specific register endpoint
- Add validation and error handling
- Add tests
- Status: NOT STARTED

### Task 5: Reset Processor API
- Implement reset endpoint
- Add validation and error handling
- Add tests
- Status: NOT STARTED

### Task 6: API Documentation and Final Integration
- Complete OpenAPI documentation
- Add integration tests
- Perform final testing
- Status: NOT STARTED

## Technical Achievements
1. Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. Comprehensive test coverage
3. Proper error handling with specific exceptions
4. RESTful API design following best practices
5. Extensible design for future enhancements

## Known Issues
None at this time.

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Task 3: Execute Batch Instructions API
2. Consider adding transaction support for batch operations
3. Plan rollback mechanism for failed batch operations
4. Design batch operation response format

## Future Considerations
1. Add support for new instruction types
2. Add support for additional registers
3. Consider adding instruction history/logging
4. Consider adding performance metrics
5. Consider adding circuit breaker for batch operations
