# Product Context: Opcode Microprocessor Simulator

## Purpose

The Opcode Microprocessor Simulator serves as a prototype for understanding and testing the instruction set of a custom microprocessor before actual hardware implementation. This software simulation allows for rapid iteration and validation of the microprocessor's design and functionality.

## Problems Solved

1. **Hardware Development Risk Reduction**:
   - Validates the instruction set design before committing to hardware implementation
   - Identifies logical flaws or inefficiencies in the instruction set early in the development process
   - Reduces the cost and time associated with hardware revisions

2. **Educational Tool**:
   - Provides a platform for understanding microprocessor architecture and instruction execution
   - Demonstrates how registers store and manipulate data
   - Illustrates the step-by-step execution of instructions

3. **Testing Platform**:
   - Enables thorough testing of instruction sequences and edge cases
   - Allows for validation of expected behavior under various scenarios
   - Provides a reference implementation for hardware verification

## How It Should Work

The simulator should:

1. **Accurately Model Register Behavior**:
   - Maintain the state of four 32-bit signed integer registers (A, B, C, D)
   - Properly handle integer operations including potential overflow/underflow conditions
   - Ensure register values remain within the valid 32-bit signed integer range

2. **Execute Instructions Faithfully**:
   - Parse and validate instruction syntax
   - Execute each instruction according to its defined behavior
   - Update register values appropriately
   - Handle error conditions gracefully

3. **Provide Clean API Access**:
   - Allow execution of single instructions via API
   - Support batch execution of multiple instructions
   - Provide access to register values
   - Enable processor state reset

4. **Maintain Extensibility**:
   - Support future addition of new instructions
   - Allow for expansion of the register set
   - Maintain clean separation of concerns for easy modification

## User Experience Goals

1. **Developer-Friendly API**:
   - RESTful endpoints with intuitive naming
   - Clear request/response formats
   - Helpful error messages
   - Comprehensive API documentation

2. **Reliable Execution**:
   - Consistent and predictable behavior
   - Proper validation of inputs
   - Appropriate error handling
   - Accurate simulation of the instruction set

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Efficient execution of instructions
   - Responsive API endpoints
   - Minimal resource utilization

4. **Testability**:
   - Easy to verify correct behavior
   - Supports automated testing
   - Provides clear feedback on execution results

## Target Users

1. **Hardware Engineers**:
   - Using the simulator to validate microprocessor design
   - Testing instruction behavior before hardware implementation

2. **Software Developers**:
   - Creating programs that will eventually run on the microprocessor
   - Testing software logic using the simulator

3. **Quality Assurance Engineers**:
   - Verifying correct behavior of the instruction set
   - Developing test cases for the microprocessor

4. **Students/Educators**:
   - Learning about microprocessor architecture
   - Experimenting with instruction execution and register manipulation
